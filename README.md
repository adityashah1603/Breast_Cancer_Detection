# Breast Cancer Detection



Breast Cancer Detection is a project that leverages machine learning techniques to identify and classify breast cancer tumors from medical images. This repository provides a comprehensive solution for early detection and diagnosis, which is crucial for improving patient outcomes.

## Overview

Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers among women worldwide. Early detection plays a vital role in effective treatment. This project focuses on utilizing machine learning algorithms to analyze medical images and classify breast tumors as malignant or benign.

## Key Features

### 1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - The dataset undergoes thorough preprocessing to enhance image quality and prepare it for model training.
   - Data augmentation techniques may be applied to increase the diversity of the training set.

### 2. **Machine Learning Models:**
   - Employs various machine learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Support Vector Machines (SVMs), and Random Forests for breast cancer classification.
   - Model selection is flexible, allowing users to choose the algorithm that best suits their requirements.

### 3. **Performance Evaluation:**
   - Provides metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate the model's performance.
   - The confusion matrix and ROC curves are visualized for a comprehensive understanding of the model's behavior.
